# Open Project theme helpers

Jekyll plugin for the Open Project gem-based Jekyll theme by Ribose.

It provides the data reading and page generation capabilities
required by the theme.

Currently it enables such features as tag-based filtering
of open software and specification indexes, unified blog index,
fetching open project/software/specification data from their repos.
